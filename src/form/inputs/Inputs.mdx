# Inputs

The library provides a set of "input" components. All of them share the same common structure and props.
Each input component automatically subscribe to the nearest form that wraps it, and will be automatically validated and updated.

Generically, to make an input fully functional, you only need to specify its `name` and `defaultValue`.

```jsx
<TextInput name="firstName" defaultValue="Mario" />
```

To add more complex validation logics on them, you can use the `schema` prop,
based on the [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) library.

```jsx
<TextInput name="firstName" defaultValue="Mario" />
```

### TextInput

<TextInput />
